code for joint connectivity based sparse canonical correlation analysis

Our study aims to improve SCCA to be more efficient and interpretable. We propose a novel connectivity-based constraint to incorporate biological prior information. Our proposed approach, termed joint-connectivity-based SCCA (JCB-SCCA), includes a novel constraint and can handle multimodal neuroimaging datasets.
